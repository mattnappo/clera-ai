We will\nuse the o\u000ecial class time for online lectures and discussion. Information on\nconnecting to the virtual classroom via Zoom is below.\n\u000fTime: Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00 pm - 3:15 pm Eastern Time\n\u000fZoom ID: 973 4704 8118\n\u000fZoom Passcode: 217282\n3 Electronic Recording of Class\nPer University policy, the instructor will be recording the course material (lec-\ntures and discussions) and making it available to students to ensure that ev-\neryone, both on and o\u000b campus, have access to the same course content. This\nmaterial may be made available to everyone on the University campus.\nThe instructor and TA will not record o\u000ece hour discussions to ensure\nstudent privacy. Students attending o\u000ece hours may opt to make recordings of\ntheir discussions with the instructor and TA if desired.\n1\n4 Technology Requirements\nStudents will need the following equipment to take the course. Please note that\nsome of the software provides encrypted, authenticated network services while\nothers provide a virtual private network connection to the University campus.\nO\u000b-campus students are encouraged to check whether the use of the required\nhardware and software is consistent with the laws of their locality.\n\u000fA computer capable of running Zoom.\n\u000fA web camera that enables the student to use Zoom video.\n\u000fA web brower that can connect to Blackboard (https://learn.rochester.edu)\nand to the University of Rochester online library.\n\u000fAn ssh client that can connect to the Computer Science Department's Edu-\ncation machines (i.e., cycle1.csug.rochester.edu, cycle2.csug.rochester.edu,\ncycle3.csug.rochester.edu, cycle4.csug.rochester.edu)\n\u000fA Virtual Private Network (VPN) client that can connect to the campus\nnetwork if that is needed to use the aforementioned University Services.\n\u000fAn Internet connection that allows for the use of Zoom to attend lecture\nin real-time.\n\u000fAn Internet connection that allows for the use of ssh to complete the pro-\ngramming assignments. The connnection must reliably support interactive\nprogramming sessions.\n5 Prerequisites\n\u000fCSC 252 or equivalent\n\u000fFor CSC 256 and CSC 456, C/C++ programming on Unix systems\n6 Textbooks\nWhile there are no required textbooks for the course, students are strongly en-\ncouraged to use a textbook on operating system kernel principles and a textbook\non Linux kernel internals. Most textbooks are available in Carlson library; some\ncan be read online via the University of Rochester Library web site.\n6.1 Textbooks on Operating System Principles\nStudents should use a book on basic operating system principles and algorithms.\nThere are three suggested texts:\n2\n\u000fTanenbaum: Modern Operating Systems , Fourth Edition by Andrew Tanen-\nbaum and Herbert Bos\n\u000fSGG: Operating System Concepts , Ninth Edition by Silberschatz, Galvin,\nand Gagne\n\u000fAD:Operating Systems: Principles and Practice , Second Edition by Thomas\nAnderson and Michael Dahlin\n6.2 Textbooks on Linux Kernel Internals\nStudents will want to use a book that explains the internal implementation of\nthe Linux kernel. There are two suggested texts:\n\u000fUnderstanding the Linux Kernel by Bovet and Cesati\n\u000fLinux Kernel Development by Love\n6.3 Supplementary Readings\nThere are some readings that are taken from books that are available online via\nthe library. These are:\n\u000fAPE: Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by W. Richard\nStevens\n\u000fFreeBSD: The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating Sys-\ntemby McKusick, Neville-Neil, and Watson\nFinally, a few reading assignments will be taken from research papers avail-\nable online. Links to them will be provided on Blackboard.\n7 Grading\n7.1 Programming Assignments\nThere will be about three to four programming assignments. These program-\nming assignments will require signi\fcant e\u000bort and time; the idea is to have you\nlearn by experience. Be sure to start on them as soon as they are distributed!\nProgramming assignments are to be completed on the department's edu-\ncational servers e.g., cycle1.csug.rochester.edu, cycle2.csug.rochester.edu, etc.\nYour code must work on these machines as we will use only these machines to\ngrade programming assignments. Code provided for programming assignments\nis only supported on the educational servers; the instructor and TA will not solve\nproblems with the code that occurs when it runs on unsupported hardware.\n3\n7.2 Homeworks\nThere will be written homework assignments. These homeworks will be due\napproximately every one to two weeks. Homeworks are designed to help students\npractice answering questions using the material taught in class.\nThe instructors will not check homework answers for correctness while grad-\ning; students are expected to review their answers using the answer keys that\nthe instructors will provide and should seek assistance in class or in o\u000ece hours\nif they cannot determine why their answer is incorrect. Homeworks will be as-\nsessed on whether the student made a reasonable e\u000bort to answer the questions.\n7.3 Quizzes\nStudents will be given quizzes to complete online individually. We anticipate\nassigning a quiz every two weeks. The instructors will grade quizzes for correct-\nness, and the score will count towards the \fnal course grade.\n7.4 Exams\nThis semester, there will be one \fnal cumulative exam at the end of the semester\nthat will cover all material from the course. The purpose of this exam is to help\nstudents recall information learned earlier in the semester.\n7.5 Final Grade Breakdown\nStudents taking CSC 456 or TCS 456 will need to do an extra project and may\nhave more challenging assignments at the instructor's discretion.\n7.5.1 CSC 256\nThe division of the grade for CSC 256 is as follows:\n\u000fProgramming Assignments: 40%\n\u000fHomeworks: 10%\n\u000fQuizzes: 30%\n\u000fFinal Exam: 20%\n7.5.2 CSC 456\nThe division of the grade for CSC 456 is as follows:\n\u000fProgramming Assignments: 40%\n\u000fHomeworks: 5%\n\u000fQuizzes: 30%\n4\n\u000fFinal Exam: 15%\n\u000fProject: 10%\n7.5.3 TCS 456\nThe division of the grade for TCS 456 is as follows. However, a TCS 456\nstudent may elect to be graded using the CSC 456 grading criteria by informing\nthe instructor within two weeks of the \frst day of class.\n\u000fHomeworks: 15%\n\u000fQuizzes: 45%\n\u000fFinal Exam: 20%\n\u000fProject: 20%\n8 Policy on Machine Downtime\nUniversity lab equipment can fail. There will be no extensions for homeworks\nand programming assignments unless the equipment failure lasts longer than 24\nhours. If a lab failure lasts longer than 24 hours, the instructor will devise an\nappropriate extension.\nBlackboard is con\fgured to accept multiple assignment submissions. Stu-\ndents are encouraged to submit an initial version of each assignment a day prior\nto the deadline to contend with potential equipment failures.\n9 Late Assignment and Homework Policy\nLate programming assignments, homeworks, and projects are not accepted un-\nless there is a justi\fable reason. Justi\fable reasons include, but are not limited\nto, documented illness and family emergencies. The instructor reserves the right\nto request documentation (e.g., a doctor's note) to verify claims of illness, emer-\ngency, etc. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the instructor will\nwaive this right except in suspicious or extraordinary circumstances .\nStudents requesting an extension should consult with the instructor at least\na week before the assignment's deadline.\n10 O\u000ece Hours\nIf you have questions and cannot make it to the o\u000ece hours, please email the\ninstructor for a one-on-one appointment. The email should contain the phrase\n\\CSC256 O\u000ece Hours\" or \\CSC456 O\u000ece Hours\" in the subject.\n5\n11 Academic Honesty\nAll assignments and activities associated with this course must be performed in\naccordance with the University of Rochester's Academic Honesty Policy. More\ninformation is available at http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty.\nViolations of academic honesty include, but are not limited to , the following:\n\u000fCopying code from another group on a programming assignment\n\u000fWorking in groups larger than those authorized by the instructor\n\u000fCopying answers on written homework assignments\n\u000fCopying text from a paper without quoting the paper (even if it cites the\noriginal paper)\n\u000fCopying text from a paper and modifying the text without quoting the\noriginal paper (even if it cites the original paper)\n6\n12 Tentative Topics\nBelow is a tentative list of topics for the course.
