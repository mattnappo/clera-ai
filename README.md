Clera supplements your education by providing you with a machine learning based academic assistant, helping you derive insights from your course syllabi. Ranging from summarizing important information to an interactive Q&A, Clera will help you efficiently find what you need. 

Login/sign up on the site, then upload your course syllabi and let Clera do the rest! It helpfully displays everything you need to know about your courses in one place, and allows you to ask any question you want, e.g. "When is my first exam?" Gone are the days of searching through endless pages of syllabi to find that one piece of information you are looking for! Clera can also be found in your pocket, with full Siri integration. Simply ask Siri what you want to know about your courses!
